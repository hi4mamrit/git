== First Section
FIrst it was blank
->committed  using "git commit"
->git add README.md helo.txt
->git commit -m "initial commit"

== Second  Section
NOw I add this section to hello.txt <Now check "git status". IT should say modified>
-> git commit -a -m "new changes" 

== Third Section
Now I thought , I don't want to track README.md further via GIT.
-> git rm --cached README.md
-> touch .gitignore
-> nano .gitignore
   type_in ---> README.md

==Third Section  part-2
NOw I think this part-2 was also needed for third section, which I missed in last commit. I dont want to create a new commit.Make the changes and-
-> git add hello.txt
-> git commit --amend --no-edit

==Fourth Section
after gitclone, making these changes  and changed from https type to ssh type authentication
-> git clone https://github.com/hi4mamrit/git.git
-> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:hi4mamrit/git.git
-> git remote -v
-> git commit -a -m "After git pull"
-> git push origin master
